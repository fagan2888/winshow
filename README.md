This tiny GUI app retrieves a list of windows in Windows System
using pywin32 and can do Show/Hide manipulations

The purpose is to retrieve windows that may have gone lost
if they were minimized to tray without having this functionality
natively implemented

If the 3rd party tool dies, the window is lost in the mist

It served a bit as a testbed for MVC class development for
guis made with wxformbuilder

TODO

- Add statistics
